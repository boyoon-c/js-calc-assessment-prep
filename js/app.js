// Instructions:  You've been given the HTML template for a JavaScript 'calculator.'  
// Implement functionality such that when two numbers are entered in the input fields, 
//    pressing one of the 'operator' buttons results in the mathematical calculation for those two numbers.  
// (Example:  If the boxes contain 3 and 4, pressing the '+' button should put a 7 in the display box.)
// (If '-' is pressed, -1 should be displayed.  If '*' is pressed, 12 should be displayed, etc...)

// EASY BONUS:  If the result is odd, change it's color to salmon.
// MEDIUM BONUS:  Use a single event listener to accomplish this task, rather than 4 of them.
// HARD BONUS:  Use a single event listener and don't use any conditionals for the math
